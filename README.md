# GIF Meme Practice Project

This is a simple practice project where I created a GIF for a Codédex challenge.

## Tools Used

- `pip3` with the `imageio` library  
- Image splitter: [PineTools](https://pinetools.com/split-image)

## Steps I Followed

- Installed the required library with `pip3 install imageio`.
- Grabbed a 4-panel meme image.
- Used PineTools to split the meme into 4 separate images.
- Placed all images in the same folder.
- Converted the sequence of images into a single GIF.
